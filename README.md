🚀 Excited to share a recent experience!

I recently got a short contract job from a friend, where I worked on cleaning and preparing customer data for analysis. The raw dataset came in as a CSV file, and here’s a quick rundown of what I did:

✅ Converted the CSV to an Excel workbook and created a backup copy.

✅ Removed duplicate entries from the Customer ID column.

✅ Cleaned up inconsistencies in the Gender field (e.g., “F”, “M”, “Femalee” → standardized).

✅ Reformatted the Income column to a dollar format.

✅ Filled missing values in the Email column with unknown@email.com.

✅ Standardized customer names using the PROPER() function.

✅ Fixed the Date column by splitting with Text to Columns, restructuring, then restoring with DATEVALUE().

📉 After cleaning, the dataset went from 3,000 entries to 50 unique customers — a huge difference that highlights how much duplicate and messy data can inflate datasets.

This was a great reminder that data cleaning is just as important as analysis — because reliable insights can only come from clean, accurate data. 💡

Grateful for the opportunity, and looking forward to doing more impactful work in data analytics.
